### Looping queries: Hello, World
In our context, this implementation is basically the "Hello, World" of query
strategies.
It'll get the job done, but if you want to do anything more, it's not the best way
of doing things.

The code for querying data from ScyllaDB is in `query.py`, and the code to 
test the speeds of this implementation is in `benchmark.py`.
