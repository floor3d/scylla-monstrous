### Multiprocessing
Python performance is no fun. Multiprocessing, however, makes performance much better! This runs separate processes instead of running the code through separate threads.

The code for querying data from ScyllaDB is in `query.py`, and the code to 
test the speeds of this implementation is in `benchmark.py`.
